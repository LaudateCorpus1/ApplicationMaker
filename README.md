# ApplicationMaker

This *Mathematica* package facilitates the integration of notebooks
to the Documentation Center. This project was created to answer a
question in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/6574710/788553).

Simply install the extracted zip into `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]`.

The are two answers provided by myself in the question, the [first
one](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6574919/788553) provides a lengthly
explanation on how to do it manually.

The [second one](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6660444/788553) provides
`ApplicationMaker`.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to contribute to this
project.
